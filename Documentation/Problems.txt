- can I put more than one option? (checkboxes)

- type of pain (constrictive, nevralgic ecc): I don't know what they mean

- add a note: what I have to add? Is that mandatory?

- other symptoms: vista affaticata is a symptom?

- summary in english instead of italian, value true

- version 2 is awful

- "any" symptoms of version 2: is not "any" it's "any other"
